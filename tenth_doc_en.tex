    \maketitle

    Here is the example document using \texttt{tenth} class. This particular example uses font size 11pt with twoside option, and thus margin notes* \marginnote{\emph{\color{DarkGray} *such as text in the margin like this}} appears on different sides for odd- and even-numbered pages (keep reading until the next page for illustration).

    \lipsum[1-5]

    There are 2--4 people around this house at 3--5 \textsc{am}. \marginnote{\emph{Actually, they are here \\ to shout} $E = mc^2$.} Do not worry; it is totally normal. These are \redsq, \greensq, and \bluesq\ respectively.
